C3TeamChooser
=============
**C3TeamChooser** Is an android app which simplifies the process of organizing a
group of students into teams. The app is made specifically for UCLA students,
and accepts identification in the form of a bruincard (by scanning the barcode
via the phone's camera) or by entering your student ID. Participants can
indicate two preferred partners if they manually enter their student ID. If this
is a participant's first time signing in via this particular system, they will 
be asked to fill out a short questionnaire. Upon filling out the questionnaire,
they will be remembered in the future (unless the application's data is
cleared). When participants have all signed in, the event's coordinators can hit
the "Make Teams" button, and the application will automatically partition
everyone who has signed in that day into groups of three.
